# Parking_Space_Counter

This project uses computer vision to detect and count available parking spaces in real-time from a video feed.
By leveraging OpenCV, the system can identify empty and occupied spots, providing an instant count of available spaces.
This was a personal project to apply and enhance my skills in Python and computer vision.
